docosx sphinx doc hosting
=========================

This branch is used to host builds of the docosx sphinx doc. The actual sphinx
code is in the 'master' and related branches of this repo.

How to build sphinx docs
------------------------

To make a new build:

* ``git co master`` (or similar branch)
* ``make gh-pages`` (this will do the doc build then checkout the ``gh-pages`` branch)
* If all looks good, then ``git commit -m 'Some message'``
* To push up to github, ``git push origin gh-pages`` - or, probably, just ``git push``
* ``git co master`` or similar to return to working on the text
